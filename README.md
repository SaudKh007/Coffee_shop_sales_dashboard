# Coffee_shop_sales_dashboard
Power bi Dashboard
project abjective : I worked on this project to get better at using SQL for data cleaning and building dashboards with Power BI.
The idea was to take raw sales data from a coffee shop and turn it into something useful and easy to understand.

I focused on figuring out things like:

What products sell the most?

When are the busiest times of day?

Which locations make the most money?

How often do customers visit?

The goal was to practice the full process â€” from cleaning messy data to creating visuals that tell a clear story.
